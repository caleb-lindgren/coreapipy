coreapipy - Python scripts for using the Gygi Lab Core API

Authentication: You need to have two files named .username and .api_key in the
same directory from which you are calling this library, containing those
respective pieces of information on the first line. Anything after the first
line will be ignored, so you can add other login information on subsequent lines
and change their order in the file as a crude form of identity management. To
keep track of which keys are which, comments are supported in these files,
namely, anything after a # character on any line is ignored.
